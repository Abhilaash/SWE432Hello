# A pretty Simple Servlet/JSP using Heroku

This tutorial will show you how to deploy a Heroku app that allows running Servlets and JSPs.

# Create GitHub and Heroku accounts

You can create accounts for free in both platforms (do not provide payment info). Also, use your personal email so you can keep your accounts after you graduate:

a. https://github.com/join Use your personal email address (you can add your academic email later to access student benefits), provide your info and proceed, use the individual plan.
b. https://signup.heroku.com/ Provide your info and proceed.

Optional: You can use GitHub student package by creating an account here:https://www.heroku.com/github-students. 

# Create a Git repo and and link it to Heroku app 

## Getting this repo

If you have not install Git before, you can get it here: https://git-scm.com/downloads

If you want to skip the creation steps you can clone the finished sample and then skip to the 'Deploy Your Application to Heroku' section:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/luminaxster/swe432tomcat.git
```

## Follow the Guide

If you would like to create the application yourself, then follow the Dev Center guide on how to [Create a Java Web Application using Embedded Tomcat](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/create-a-java-web-application-using-embedded-tomcat).
